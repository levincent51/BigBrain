# Usability and Accessibility improvements

## Design Principles
### Perceivable
- No colours that are inaccessible, plain UI that isn't cluttered
- Any non-text content such as icons will have a hover and an aria-label to support screen readers
    - Non-text contents have text alternative, title and aira-label tags
- simple structure
- Text size and font are adjustable to accommodate users with low vision or visual impairments.
- Contrast between text and background is high enough to make content readable for users with color blindness or low vision.
### Operable
- No colours or screen state changes which cause seizures or prone to epilepsy
- All form fields have clear and concise instructions for completion, with error messages that are easily identifiable and understandable.
- Titles will determine which page state user in (Main feed, profiles, pop up for forms etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts are provided for frequently used actions to help users navigate the application more quickly and easily. (tab, typing and enter for forms)
- In forms, the first item will be autofocus, allowing user to quickly input and tab to next form item
- submit can be done with enter, or by tabbing to submit button
### Understandable
- Main feed is layed out to be understandable
- Any edits or deletions clearly shown (also perceivable), can go through all profiles without a disrupt in 
flow of the application
- MUI uses semantic HTML elements for reader navigation and comprehension
- All functionality operable and most have an instant response in UI (due to polling), feed is updated and so 
are comments and likes
### Robust
- aria-labels for accessibility
- mobile view is not impacted
- compatible for all browsers and modern computers, as well as mobile view
- Any audio content has a transcript or caption available.
