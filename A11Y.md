# Usability and Accessibility improvements

## Design Principles
### Perceivable
- No colours that are inaccessible, plain UI that isn't cluttered
- Any non-text content such as icons will have a hover and an aria-label to support screen readers
    - Non-text contents have text alternative, title and aira-label tags
- simple structure
### Operable
- No colours or screen state changes which cause seizures or prone to epilepsy
- Titles will determine which page state user in (Main feed, profiles, pop up for forms etc.)
- Functionality and form submits can be operable with keyboard for whole application
### Understandable
- Main feed is layed out to be understandable
- Any edits or deletions clearly shown (also perceivable), can go through all profiles without a disrupt in 
flow of the application
- All functionality operable and most have an instant response in UI (due to polling), feed is updated and so 
are comments and likes
### Robust
- aria-labels for accessibility
- compatible for all browsers and modern computers, as well as mobile view
